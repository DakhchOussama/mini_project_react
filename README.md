## React Overview ‚öõÔ∏è

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components."

### Key Concepts

- **Components:** Building blocks of a React application. Encapsulate the UI and manage their own state.
- **Props:** Parameters that components use to customize their appearance or behavior.
- **State:** Local state within a component, allowing it to manage dynamic data.
- **Lifecycle Methods:** Hooks that allow you to run code at specific points in a component's life.
